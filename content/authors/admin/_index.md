Hey visitor, I'm Dimitrios and I am a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

Before joining [Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) I studied Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My studies where mostly in theoretical computer science and data science. In my MS thesis I worked with [Grigoris](https://grigorisg9gr.github.io/) and [Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en) on properties of deep polynomial neural networks.

I am broadly interested in the topic of machine learning and signal processing. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science and the thoeretical foundation of big data analysis.

Besides CS I'm an adventure enthusiast who enjoys mountain hikes, camping and bike touring.
